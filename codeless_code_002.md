[Case 2](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/2)

A bit morbid in my opiniion, this talks about how requirements are implemented.

There will be inherant disconnect between the business and the programmers because of the biases and 
assumptions brought to the table by the programmers(and the business).

I can understand what I read; I can understand what I can hear; I can understand what I can observe.
But there are always going to be edge cases that can be attributed to the "Unknown Unknowns", the title of the chapter.
That is something that can not be escaped.
