[010 - Pride](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/10)

How much proud should a programmer be?
Pride is one of the 3 qualities mentioned by Larry Wall(Laziness, impatience and hubris).
The pride of the programmer should not blind them from seeking/reusing solutions that are already available.
Pride should not be the cause of becoming anti-social, since software development is an extremely social activity,
where communication with fellow programmers and stakeholders should be taking the highest priority.
So much of a high priority, that code itself should become a vehicle for communicating ideas across the team.
