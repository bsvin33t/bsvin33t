I hate exceptions written in my application code.

Exceptions are supposed to be for exceptional situations(IO failures, Endpoint errors, among many).

What are exceptional situations? Situations which the application programmer can not anticipate.

If there are/is a situation(s) that can be anticipated, then exceptions don't really sit well there.
