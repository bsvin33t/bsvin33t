[007 - The Enemy of the Good](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/7)

Perfection is unattainable. 

We must work with what is good enough.
To be able to work with what is good enough, we need to ensure that it is actually good enough.
This confidence is given to us by doing manual testing and by writing automated tests.
Testing is not a distraction, but an essential part of software development process,
so as to ensure the correct working of what is being produced.
