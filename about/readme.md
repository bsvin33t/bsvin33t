# Here is how I work.

The questions and ansewers here are based on [this pdf](https://github.com/bsvin33t/bsvin33t/blob/master/about/about.pdf)
I want to try and keep this document alive.

## Technology:

Why did I pick ruby?

The first time I heard ruby(and rails) was sometime in the final year of my university(2010), but didn't think much about it.
This was when I started my career as a presales-support-professional-services engineer with Parasoft.

One day I visited a friend, and I was hanging out with his friend, who was working with akamai, he started to rave about ruby on rails.
I got curious and installed it on my computer. Playing with the scaffolding just blew me away. It was so easy to create a web-app!

Ruby block syntax and Rails magic was a little off putting for me, and I wanted something simple.
I went with Udacity's web programming course where Steve Huffman teaches python with flask and deploy to google app engine.
I was able to work on the example quite well.

In the meantime, I was attending my local programmer user groups. BRUG(Bangalore ruby user group) was one meetup group that was quite regular.
I started to attend it and found out that quite a few agencies wanted to hire programmers. I applied to one of them(Multunus) and got a programming assignment.
I finished it with python and got in.

TLDR: First company got it on to me.
