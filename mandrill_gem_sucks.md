# Mandrill api gem sucks

[mandrill api gem](https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-ruby) does not know how to handle its own api errors.
Fails in a very strange way. 

Does not contain specs.

And, we can't even open issues on it.

Why not just open up the gem, allow outside contributions on it. Probably company policies...Eh, whatever.


Update: We are no longer using mandrill to send out transaction emails from our system.
We are using our own sendmail service to send out emails. So, no more mandrill, no more worries about mailchimp downtime and strange errors that come out of it.


Please feel free to raise an issue if you felt this post needs more information.

Cheers
