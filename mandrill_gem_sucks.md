# Mandrill api gem sucks

[mandrill api gem](https://bitbucket.org/mailchimp/mandrill-api-ruby) does not know how to handle its own api errors.
Fails in a very strange way. 

Does not contain specs.

And, we can't even open issues on it.

Why not just open up the gem, allow outside contributions on it. Probably company policies...Eh, whatever.


Please feel free to raise an issue if you felt this post needs more information.

Cheers
