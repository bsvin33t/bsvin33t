[004 - Willows](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/4)

I did take some time to realize this. I felt that there was insufficient information for judging what is correct. The below is my interpration of the koan

This is a refleection on the ability to recognize potential and understanding feedback, and using judgement when applying it.

The new priest was let go because they were unable to recognize and judge what is grass, what is willow, what is mutable and what is not,
and the potential of their subordinates.

And thus, `We cannot lie across a thousand willows and contemplate the sunrise.`
