[Intro]
| Fmaj7 | Em   | Fmaj7 | Em   | x 2

[Pre-Verse]
C/G                 Em
  Ground control to Major Tom
C/G                 Em
  Ground control to Major Tom
Am          Am7/G             D7/F#
  Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
C/G                 Em
  Ground control to Major Tom
C/G                    Em
  Commencing countdown engines on
Am        Am/G            D7/F#
  Check ignition and may God's love be with you

[Verse 1]
C                                 E7
This is ground control to Major Tom
                       F
You've really made the grade
    Fm              C                       F
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
    Fm                     C              F
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
  C                                E7
This is Major Tom to ground control
                         F
I'm stepping through the door
    Fm                   C          F
And I'm floating in a most-a peculiar way
    Fm        C                   F
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
Fmaj7         Em
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Fmaj7         Em
Far above the world
Bb              Am9               G             F
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental]
| C F G | A A | x2
| Fmaj7 | Em  |  A9 | C/G | D/A | E

[Verse 2]
C                                     E7
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
                     F
I'm feeling very still
    Fm         C                            F
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
     Fm                 C             F
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

[Bridge]
G                 E7         Am                   C
Ground control to Major Tom, your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
        D7/F#   				    C/G
Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you hear me Major Tom?
        G
Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you...

[Chorus]

[Outro](same as instrumental)
