# One of my favourite dish, Kadai paneer.

I make this dish in 2 steps. The first one being the gravy and the next one, where I shallow fry the veggies and paneer in a pan.

## Ingredients:
* A frying pot/something that is like a wok with a lid
* Paprika(squares, around 2cm x 2cm or some shape that is convinient to you)
* Onion(chopped as chunks, around the same size as the paprika)
* Paneer 250gms(Cubes around 1 to 2cm in all directions)
* Coriander leaves
* Oil(4 to 5 table spoons)
* Whole cumin seeds - 1 tea spoon
* Ginger garlic paste - 1.5 table spoons 
* Onion(2 medium sized as paste in blender)
* Masalas:
  * Coriander powder - 1 tea spoon
  * Cumin powder - 1 tea spoon
  * Crushed chilly flakes(optional) - 1/2 tea spoon
  * Pepper powder - 1/2 tea spoon
  * Garam masala - 1/2 tea spoon
  * Trumuric - 1/2 tea spoon
  * Salt - 1 tea spoon
* Tomato paste(3 tomatoes + 2 green chillies + 6 to 10 cashewes)
* Kashmiri red powder(for colour) - 1 tea spoon
* Crush Kasoori Methi - 1 tea spoon
* Fresh cream - 4 table spoons 


### Steps to make gravy

1. Heat the oil in a pan in medium to high heat(6 to 8) for 3 mins
2. When the oil is hot enough, turn off the heat, put the cumin seeds and wait for it to roast(takes approximately half a minute)
3. Once the cumin fries, pour the onion paste into it. 
    Careful! The onion has water, it is going to splatter. Try to protect yourself with the lid of the pan by shutting the pan as soon as you put the onion.
4. Turn on the heat back to medium heat(6 or 7), wait until some of the water of the onion is gone and the onion not spitting a lot hot oil.
5. At this stage, put the ginger garlic paste, half a glass of water(around 50 ml), stirr well, cover the lid
6. Wait for 8 minutes. During this time the heat is still on medium.
7. After the 8 minutes, start putting the masalas and pour another half cup of water(around 50 ml), stirr well, cover the lid.
8. Wait for around 4 minutes, to get the masala to cook.
9. Add tomato paste, kashmiri red chilli powder, stiff well, cover the lid.
10. Wait for 12 to 15 minutes on medium heat(6 or 7).
11. Turn the heat to low(3 or 4)
11. Add the crushed kasoori methi, stir well
12. Pour the cream, stirr well.

### Steps to prepare veggies and paneer

1. For paneer, melt some butter/butterschmaltz on a pan fry the cut paneers on it.
Keep it aside.
2. For veggies, fry the onion peices and paprika peices in a few spoons of oil and a pinch of salt(this gets the water to come out).
