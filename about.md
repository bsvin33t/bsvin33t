I am a software developer for the last 8 years, and with the IT industry for 10, with the first 2 as a support engineer. I have worked on the side where the customer is delighted to experience great support, as well as  build features that bring value to the customer(and other teams). I have worked as an individual contributor as well as lead projects. I have worked on green field projects, as well as projects as old as 7 years. Large teams and alone. I have been lucky to work with some amazing, motivated people.
