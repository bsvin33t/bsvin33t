[005 - Void](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/5)

What is Void? 
It is nothging. It is everything and anything the programmer wishes.

In imperative C style programming language:

It is the value returned by a method that does not return anything. It can be used to point at any datatype.
It is used to indicate the absence of a value.

In function programming, it is used to indicate side-effects from a function.

Being in a mostly OOP-imperative style environment, I'm unable to contemplate the mening of `void` in functional programming. Hopefully, I will be able to add more here once I grain more experience.
