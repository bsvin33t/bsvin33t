[003- Encapsulation](http://thecodelesscode.com/case/3) 

I find this "story" to be a bit amusing. 
What I think the master is trying to inform the young monk is that data has to flow through the correct abstractions before entering the system else,
it is going to cause unintended outcomes.

Encapsulation allows us to ensure that this is enforced.
