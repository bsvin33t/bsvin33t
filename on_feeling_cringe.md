### On feeling the cringe

Why does that cringeworthy thought stay in our mind and cause discomfort?

I had this question. From what I understand by looking around this is the conclusion that I came to.

This is beause we associate the event/action to be a threat or a danger for our survival.
And, in the face of danger, the lizardd brain activates the fight/flight response. This inturn solidifies into our subconscious that we encountered a dangerous situation.
As we are(or were) on a survival mode, and we want to avoid dangerous sitiuations, we end up keeping this memories and associations.
