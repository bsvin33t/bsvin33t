|The Beatles|Rubber Soul| Very good, I like the Beatles.

I also feel it just can not go wrong when you listen to artists live. All the songs that they choose to play live is going to be pretty amazing. Especially, if the songs are from the albums that I like.

Also, I feel the live acts might become a little monotonous, as the band plays only their popular stuff and the "artsy stuff" might get ignored.
